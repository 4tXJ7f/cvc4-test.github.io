# In Memoriam: Morgan Deters

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/morgan-deters.png" description="" %}

Morgan Deters was a senior research scientist at the Courant Institute of New
York University and an influential contributor to research in formal methods
and verification, with a focus on satisfiability modulo theories.  On January
17, 2015, he unexpectedly passed away.  Morgan was deeply respected and admired
by all of his colleagues at NYU and in the broader research community for both
his friendly demeanor and his remarkable talents as a scientist.  We are all
deeply saddened by his loss.

We his colleagues have created this page to allow those who knew him to share
their thoughts and feelings to honor his memory.
