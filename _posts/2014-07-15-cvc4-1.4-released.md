We are delighted to announce version 1.4 of CVC4, the open-source flagship SMT
solver developed at New York University and the University of Iowa, available
at [http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu).

Version 1.4 features a new decision procedure for a theory of finite sets,
numerous improvements to arithmetic, strings, bitvectors, and other theories,
improved handling of quantified assertions, generally improved usability and
stability, and many bugfixes.  This 1.4 release is very near to the version
submitted for this year’s CASC and SMT-COMP competitions.

We welcome feedback, feature requests, contributions, and collaborations.  It
is our hope that CVC4 will become a research platform for a broad and diverse
set of users and developers.  If you are interested in getting involved with
