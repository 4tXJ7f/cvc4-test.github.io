We are pleased to announce the first public release of CVC4, version 1.0, the
open-source flagship SMT solver developed at New York University and the
University of Iowa, available at
[http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu).

CVC4 is the latest in the CVC series of SMT solvers and provides the
functionality of its predecessors while dramatically boosting performance.
Features include:

- support for the native (CVC) language as well as the SMT-LIB standard language;
- decision procedures for the following theories and their combination:
  equality with uninterpreted functions, real and integer linear arithmetic,
  bit-vectors, arrays, tuples, records, and user-defined inductive data types;
- support for quantifiers through heuristic instantiation;
- an interactive text-based interface;
- a rich API for embedding in other systems (available for C++ and Java);
- model generation abilities;
- source compatibility with much of the CVC3 API via a “compatibility library”;
- essentially no limit on the use of source or binaries for research or
  commercial purposes (details on the license can be found on the web site).

We welcome feedback, feature requests, contributions, and collaborations.  It
is our hope that CVC4 will become a research platform for a broad and diverse
set of users and developers.  If you are interested in getting involved with
the project, please contact a member of the development team:
