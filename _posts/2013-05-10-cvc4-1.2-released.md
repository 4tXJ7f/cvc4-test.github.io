We are delighted to announce version 1.2 of CVC4, the open-source flagship SMT
solver developed at New York University and the University of Iowa, available
at [http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu).

In version 1.2, real arithmetic now has three simplex solvers for exact
precision linear arithmetic: the classical dual solver and two new solvers
based on techniques for minimizing the sum of infeasibilities.
[GLPK](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) can now be used as a heuristic backup
to the exact precision solvers.  See `cvc4 --help` for more information on
enabling these solvers.

Additionally, this release:

- adds support for "bit0" and "bit1" bitvector constants in SMT-LIB v1.2
- has support for theory "alternates": new ability to prototype new decision
  procedures that are selectable at runtime
- includes important bug fixes and performance improvements over the previous
  stable release (version 1.1)

We welcome feedback, feature requests, contributions, and collaborations. It
is our hope that CVC4 will become a research platform for a broad and diverse
set of users and developers. If you are interested in getting involved with
the project, please contact a member of the development team:
