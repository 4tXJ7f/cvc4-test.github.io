We are delighted to announce version 1.3 of CVC4, the open-source flagship SMT
solver developed at New York University and the University of Iowa, available
at [http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu).

Version 1.3 adds improved SMT-LIB support, a new decision procedure for string
constraints, support for TPTP’s TFF and TFA formats, and numerous improvements
to the library interface, especially the Java language bindings.

Additionally, this release:

- adds support for new arithmetic operations which were previously missing
	(`abs`, `to_real`, `to_int`, and `is_int`)
- adds support for bitvector-integer conversion operations (`bv2nat` and
	`int2bv`)
- includes important bug fixes and performance improvements over the previous
	stable release (version 1.2)

We welcome feedback, feature requests, contributions, and collaborations.  It
is our hope that CVC4 will become a research platform for a broad and diverse
set of users and developers.  If you are interested in getting involved with
