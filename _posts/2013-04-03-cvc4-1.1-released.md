We are delighted to announce version 1.1 of CVC4, the open-source flagship SMT
solver developed at New York University and the University of Iowa, available
at [http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu).

Version 1.1 includes numerous important bug fixes, performance improvements,
and usability improvements over the previous stable release (version 1.0).
Additionally, 1.1 features:

- a new, specialized decision procedure for unsigned bit-vector inequalities
- improved support for Mac and Windows, and binary releases for these platforms
- better support for finite model finding, used in conjunction with incremental mode
- an improved E-matching procedure
- extended support for Boolean terms in datatypes
- support for multiline input in interactive mode

We welcome feedback, feature requests, contributions, and collaborations.  It
is our hope that CVC4 will become a research platform for a broad and diverse
set of users and developers.  If you are interested in getting involved with
