We are delighted to announce version 1.5 of CVC4, the open-source flagship SMT
solver developed at Stanford University, New York University and the University
of Iowa, available at
[http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu](http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu).

Version 1.5 now supports unsat cores, proofs (for uninterpreted functions,
arrays and bit-vectors and their combinations), and features numerous
improvements to non-linear arithmetic, strings, sets and other theories,
improved handling of quantifiers, native support for syntax-guided synthesis
(SyGuS), generally improved usability and stability, and many bugfixes. This
version is very close to the version of CVC4 submitted to the SMT-competition
2017.

We welcome feedback, feature requests, contributions, and collaborations.  It
is our hope that CVC4 will become a research platform for a broad and diverse
set of users and developers.  If you are interested in getting involved with
the project, please contact a member of the development team.

- The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (award FA9550-09-1-0596)
- The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (award FA8750-13-2-0241)
