for satisfiability of quantified formulas in first-order theories, including its correctness,
implementation, and evaluation. Using this framework we derive decision procedures for
linear real arithmetic (LRA) and linear integer arithmetic (LIA) formulas with one quantifier
alternation. We discuss extensions of these techniques for handling mixed real and
integer arithmetic, and to formulas with arbitrary quantifier alternations. For the latter, we
use a novel strategy that handles quantified formulas that are not in prenex normal form,
which has advantages with respect to existing approaches. All of these techniques can be
integrated within the solving architecture used by typical SMT solvers. Experimental results
on standardized benchmarks from model checking, static analysis, and synthesis show that
our implementation in the SMT solver CVC4 outperforms existing tools for quantified linear
arithmetic."

techniques for dealing with quantified formulas in SMT are generally incomplete,
forcing SMT solvers to report 'unknown' when they fail to prove the unsatisfiability

their usefulness in applications that produce queries involving quantified formulas.
In this paper, we reduce these limitations by integrating finite model finding

rely on or could benefit from automatic solvers that can check the satisfiability

Until recently, satisfiability solvers for strings were standalone tools 
that could reason only about fairly restricted fragments of the theory 
of strings and regular expressions such as, for instance, strings
of bounded lengths.
These solvers were based on reductions to satisfiability problems 
over other data types, such as bit vectors, or to automata decision problems.
We present a set of algebraic techniques for solving constraints over 
a rich theory of unbounded strings natively, without reduction 
to other problems. 
These techniques can be used to integrate string reasoning into general, 
multi-theory SMT solvers based on the DPLL(T) architecture.
We have implemented them in our SMT solver CVC4 to expand 
its already large set of built-in theories to a theory of strings 
with concatenation, length, and membership in regular languages.
This implementation makes CVC4 the first solver able to accept 
a rich set of mixed constraints over strings, integers, reals, arrays 
and algebraic datatypes.
Our initial experimental results show that, in addition, 
over pure string problems, CVC4 is highly competitive  
with specialized string solvers with a comparable input language."

Efficient reasoning about strings is essential to a growing number of
security and verification applications. We describe satisfiability checking techniques
in an extended theory of strings that includes operators commonly occurring
in these applications, such as contains, index of and replace. We introduce
a novel context-dependent simplification technique that improves the scalability
of string solvers on challenging constraints coming from real-world problems.
Our evaluation shows that an implementation of these techniques in the SMT
solver CVC4 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art string solvers on benchmarks
generated using PyEx, a symbolic execution engine for Python programs.
Using a test suite sampled from four popular Python packages, we show that
PyEx uses only 41\% of the runtime when coupled with CVC4 than when coupled
with CVC4's closest competitor while achieving comparable program coverage.

We consider the problem of deciding the theory of finite sets with cardinality
constraints in a satisfiability modulo theories solver.  Sets are a common
high-level data structure used in programming; thus, such a theory is useful
for modeling program constructs directly. More importantly, sets are a basic
construct of mathematics and thus natural to use when mathematically defining
the properties of a computer system.  We develop a calculus consisting of a
modular combination of a procedure for reasoning about membership constraints
and a procedure for reasoning about cardinality constraints. The reasoning for
cardinality involves tracking how different sets overlap. For efficiency, we
avoid considering Venn regions directly, which has been the approach in earlier
work.  Instead, we develop a novel technique wherein potentially overlapping
regions are considered incrementally. We use a graph to track the interaction
of the different regions.  Early experimental results demonstrate that the new
technique is competitive with previous techniques and scales much better on
certain classes of problems.

checkable proof can serve as a certificate of correctness and can be mined to
gain additional insight into the problem. We present a method of encoding and
checking SMT-generated proofs for the quantifier-free theory of fixed-width bitvectors.
Proof generation and checking for this theory poses several challenges,
especially for proofs based on reductions to propositional logic. Such reductions
can result in large resolution subproofs in addition to requiring a proof that the
reduction itself is correct. We describe a fine-grained proof system formalized
in the LFSC framework that addresses some of these challenges with the use of
computational side-conditions. We report results using a proof-producing version

In this work, we show how SMT solvers can be used to obtain complete
decision procedures for local theory extensions, an important class

present an algorithm that uses E-matching to generate instances incrementally
during the search, significantly reducing the number of generated

                  such solvers in the context of SMT have concluded that in
                  addition to being potentially unsound, such solvers are too
                  heavyweight to compete in the context of SMT.  In this paper,
                  we describe a technique for integrating LP solvers that
                  dramatically improves the performance of SMT solvers without
                  compromising correctness.  These techniques have been
                  implemented using the SMT solver CVC4 and the LP solver GLPK.
                  Experiments show that this implementation outperforms other
                  state-of-the-art SMT solvers on the QF\_LRA SMT-LIB
                  benchmarks and is competitive on the QF\_LIA benchmarks."

  abstract  = "The standard method for deciding bit-vector constraints is via eager
reduction to propositional logic. This is usually done after first applying powerful
rewrite techniques. While often efficient in practice, this method does not scale on
problems for which top-level rewrites cannot reduce the problem size sufficiently.
A lazy solver can target such problems by doing many satisfiability checks, each
of which only reasons about a small subset of the problem. In addition, the lazy
approach enables a wide range of optimization techniques that are not available
to the eager approach. In this paper we describe the architecture and features
of our lazy solver (LBV). We provide a comparative analysis of the eager and
lazy approaches, and show how they are complementary in terms of the types
of problems they can efficiently solve. For this reason, we propose a portfolio
approach that runs a lazy and eager solver in parallel. Our empirical evaluation
shows that the lazy solver can solve problems none of the eager solvers can and
that the portfolio solver outperforms other solvers both in terms of total number
of problems solved and the time taken to solve them."

on or could benefit from automatic solvers that can check the satisfiability of constraints
over a rich set of data types that includes character strings. Unfortunately,
most string solvers today are standalone tools that can reason only about (some
fragment) of the theory of strings and regular expressions, sometimes with strong
restrictions on the expressiveness of their input language. These solvers are based
on reductions to satisfiability problems over other data types, such as bit vectors,
or to automata decision problems. We present a set of algebraic techniques for
solving constraints over the theory of unbounded strings natively, without reduction
to other problems. These techniques can be used to integrate string reasoning
into general, multi-theory SMT solvers based on the DPLL(T) architecture. We
have implemented them in our SMT solver CVC4 to expand its already large set
of built-in theories to a theory of strings with concatenation, length, and membership
in regular languages. Our initial experimental results show that, in addition,
over pure string problems, CVC4 is highly competitive with specialized string
solvers with a comparable input language."

is generally efficient in practice, its local pivoting heuristics
lead to slow convergence on some problems. More traditional
Simplex algorithms minimize a global criterion to determine the
feasibility of the input constraints. We present a novel Simplexbased

to deal with quantified formulas. Current work shows that for formulas with quantifiers
over uninterpreted sorts counter-models can be obtained by integrating a
finite model finding capability into the architecture of a modern SMT solver. We
examine various strategies for on-demand quantifier instantiation in this setting.
Here, completeness can be achieved by considering all ground instances over the
finite domain of each quantifier. However, exhaustive instantiation quickly becomes
unfeasible with larger domain sizes. We propose instantiation strategies to
identify and consider only a selection of ground instances that suffices to determine
the satisfiability of the input formula. We also examine heuristic quantifier
instantiation techniques such as E-matching for the purpose of accelerating the
search. We give experimental evidence that our approach is practical for use in
industrial applications and is competitive with other approaches."

This paper presents a reformulation of the Nelson-Oppen method that takes into account explicit equality propagation and can ignore pairs of shared variables that the theories do not care about. We show the correctness of the new approach and present care functions for the theory of uninterpreted functions and the theory of arrays. The effectiveness of the new method is illustrated by experimental results demonstrating a dramatic performance improvement on benchmarks combining arrays and bit-vectors."

CVC4 represents a completely new code base; it is a from-scratch rewrite of CVC3, and many subsystems have been completely redesigned. Additional decision procedures for CVC4 are currently under development, but for what it currently achieves, it is a lighter-weight and higher-performing tool than CVC3.

Unfortunately, some important theories do not fall into this category (e.g. the theory of bit-vectors). To remedy this problem, previous work introduced the notion of polite theories. Polite theories can be combined with any other theory using an extension of the Nelson-Oppen approach. In this paper we revisit the notion of polite theories, fixing a subtle flaw in the original definition. We give a new combination theorem which specifies the degree to which politeness is preserved when combining polite theories. We also give conditions under which politeness is preserved when instantiating theories by identifying two sorts. These results lead to a more general variant of the theorem for combining multiple polite theories."
